Om has a string S of length N. But Om being perfectionist, doesn't likes the string. He decides to do perform M operations on the string to see if final string generated is perfect or not.

For ith operation on string, Om selects a number Ai and reverses substring covered by Ai to N - Ai + 1 position. Om then proceeds to apply (i+1)th operation on string obtained after applying ith operation. It is guaranteed that 2 * Ai ≤ N. Strings consist of latin letters in lower case and are numbered from left to right starting from position 1.

You need to report to Om the final string that he is going to obtain.

Note: The string can be as large as 105 character long!

**Input**

The first line will contain the string S

Second line contains integer M, which number of operations Om plans to apply to string

Third line contains M space separated integers Ai which represents position in string where Om is going to transform string in ith operation.

**Output**

Output a single string, final string obtained after applying all operatons one after one
