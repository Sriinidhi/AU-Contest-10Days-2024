**Scholarship Redemption**

Raunit is a recipient of the prestigious Scholarship AlgoUniversity Technology Fellowship (ATF), a fully funded mentorship-cum-scholarship program aimed at nurturing first and second-year students passionate about computer science.

He has successfully completed his program and earned n mentorship credits. He now wishes to redeem his mentorship credits, which are available in certain denominations.

The denominations of mentorship credits that can be redeemed are as follows: 1, 5, 10, 20, and 100 credits per session.

Raunit is eager to redeem n credits in the fewest number of sessions possible. Can you help Raunit redeem all his mentorship credits in the most optimal way?

**Input**

The first and only line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109), which is the number of mentorship credits Raunit has.

**Output**

Output the minimum number of sessions Raunit would need to redeem his total mentorship credits.

**Examples**

Input1

125

Output1

3

Input2

43

Output2

5

**Explanation**

In the first sample case, Raunit can redeem his 125 mentorship credits as follows:

1 session of 100 credits

1 session of 20 credits

1 session of 5 credits

Thus, he needs 3 sessions to redeem his credits.

In the second sample case, Raunit can redeem his 43 mentorship credits by:

2 sessions of 20 credits

3 sessions of 1 credit

Therefore, Raunit completes his redemption in 5 sessions.
