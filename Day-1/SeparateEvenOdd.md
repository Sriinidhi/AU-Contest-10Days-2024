Given an array of integers, your task is to segregate the even and odd numbers. The even numbers should come first, followed by the odd numbers, while maintaining the relative order within each group.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[n] (1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105), where A[i] denotes the i-th integer in the array.

**Output**

Print the array after segregating the even numbers first and the odd numbers later, while maintaining their original order.
